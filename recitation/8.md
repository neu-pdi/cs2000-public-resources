## Recursion on Lists

Lists are structured data with two parts: a first element and the rest (which is itself a list). Although we've computed with lists using for loops, another approach is to process lists recursively.

## Discovering Patterns Through Examples

### Example 1: Computing the Count of Elements

**Step-by-Step Examples:**

- `my-count(empty)` is 0
- `my-count([list: 7])` is 1
- `my-count([list: 3, 8, 5])` is 3
  - Notice: The first element is 3, and the rest is `[list: 8, 5]`, which has count 2
  - So we can say: `my-count([list: 3, 8, 5])` is `1 + my-count([list: 8, 5])`

An empty list has count 0, and a non-empty list's count is 1 plus the count of its rest.

### Example 2: Finding the Total of Elements

**Step-by-Step Examples:**

- `my-total(empty)` is 0
- `my-total([list: 6])` is 6
- `my-total([list: 6, 4, 2])` is 6 + (total of `[list: 4, 2]`), which is 6 + 6 = 12

For a non-empty list, the total equals the first element plus the total of the rest.

## From Examples to Code

If the list is empty, return the "base case" value. If the list is non-empty, then combine the first element with the recursive call on the rest.

### Writing the Code for `my-count`

Design a recursive function `my-count` that counts the elements in a list:

```pyret
fun my-count(l :: List<Any>) -> Number:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty => # YOUR CODE HERE
    | link(f, r) => # YOUR CODE HERE
  end
where:
  my-count(empty) is 0
  my-count([list: 7]) is 1
  my-count([list: 3, 8, 5]) is 3
end
```

### Writing the Code for `my-total`

Design a recursive function `my-total` that sums the numbers in a list.

## The General Recursive Template

Write the general pattern:

```pyret
fun function-name(l :: List<T>) -> R:
  cases (List) l:
    | empty => <base-case-expression>
    | link(first, rest) => <combine first and recursive call on rest>
  end
end
```

**Explanation:**

- The input list `l` is of type `List<T>` (where `T` is the type of the elements)
- The function returns a value of type `R`
- For the empty list, we return a base case
- For a non-empty list, we combine the first element with the result of processing the rest

## Practice with the Template

### Writing a Filter Function

Design a recursive function that keeps only even numbers from a list.

## Wrap-Up

- When might recursion be cleaner than using a for-loop?
- What happens if you forget the base case in a recursive function?
