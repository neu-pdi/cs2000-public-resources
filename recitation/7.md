## Structured Data

Many pieces of real-world information consist of several parts that should be kept together. Structured data bundles multiple fields into a single value.

### Defining a Structured Data Type

Define a new data type called `Student` to represent a student:

```pyret
data Student:
  | student(name :: String, id :: Number, gpa :: Number)
end
```

### Creating Examples

Create instances of `Student` using the constructor `student`:

```pyret
alice = student("Alice Smith", 12345, 3.7)
bob = student("Bob Martinez", 23456, 3.2)
carol = student("Carol Johnson", 34567, 3.9)
```

What do you expect to happen if you try to create a student with a string for the ID number?

### Extracting Fields

Design a function `student-info` that returns a formatted string for a student:


```

What is the result of `student-info(alice)`?

### Writing Functions with Structured Data

Design a function `honors-student` that returns true if a student has a GPA of 3.5 or higher:



## Conditional Data

Sometimes data can come in multiple forms and we need a way to represent alternatives within one type. Conditional data can be one of several variants.

### Defining a Conditional Data Type

Define a new type called `OrderType` with three variants:

```pyret
data OrderType:
  | pickup
  | delivery(address :: String, tip :: Number)
  | curbside(car-color :: String, license-plate :: String)
end
```

How many different ways can someone receive their order according to our OrderType?

### Creating Examples

Create instances of `OrderType`:

```pyret
order-1 = pickup
order-2 = delivery("360 Huntington Ave, Boston MA", 5.00)
order-3 = curbside("red", "ABC123")
```

### Taking Apart Variants with `cases`

Design a function `order-instructions` that returns instructions for fulfilling an order:

```pyret
fun order-instructions(o :: OrderType) -> String:
  cases (OrderType) o:
    | pickup => # YOUR CODE HERE
    | delivery(addr, tip-amount) => # YOUR CODE HERE
    | curbside(color, plate) => # YOUR CODE HERE
  end
where:
  order-instructions(pickup) is "Order ready for pickup at counter"
  order-instructions(order-3) is "Look for red car with plate ABC123 in parking lot"
end
```

### Processing Fields in Variants

Design a function `total-cost` that calculates the total cost including any service fees:

What information do we use and ignore in each case?

## Wrap-Up

When would you use structured data instead of separate variables? Why is pattern matching with `cases` better than using if-statements for conditional data?
