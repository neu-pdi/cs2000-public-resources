title: Lab 6 â€” Practice with `for each` and lists
---

## Skills: [3](</skills/#(3)>)

For all of these problems, first implement them with `for each`. Afterwards, see if there is a way to implement them with `map` or `filter` (_without_ using any mutable variables). For some, it should be possible -- but others it may not be.

1. Design a function `sum-of-squares` that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum
   of the squares of all the numbers (i.e., square each one, then add them up).
2. Design a function `all-even` that takes a list of numbers and returns `true` if
   every number in the list is even, `false` otherwise.
3. Design a function `add-prefix` that takes a list of strings and a prefix string, and
   returns a new list where the prefix has been added to the beginning of each string.
4. Design a function `first-letters` that takes a list of non-empty strings and returns
   a new list containing just the first letter of each string.
5. Design a function `exactly-three-chars` that takes a list of strings and returns a
    new list containing only the strings that have exactly 3 characters.
6. Design a function `absolute-values` that takes a list of numbers and returns a new
    list where each number has been converted to its absolute value (use `num-abs`).
7. Design a function `count-in-range` that takes a list of numbers, a minimum value,
    and a maximum value, and returns how many numbers in the list are between the min
    and max (inclusive).
