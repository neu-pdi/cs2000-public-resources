title: Lab 6 â€” Practice with `for each` and lists
---

## Skills: [3](</skills/#(3)>)

For all of these problems, first implement them with `for each`. Afterwards, see if there is a way to implement them with `map` or `filter` (_without_ using any mutable variables). For some, it should be possible -- but others it may not be.

1. Design a function `absolute-values` that takes a list of numbers and returns a new
    list where each number has been converted to its absolute value (use `num-abs`).
2. Design a function `exactly-three-chars` that takes a list of strings and returns a
    new list containing only the strings that have exactly 3 characters.
3. Design a function `all-even` that takes a list of numbers and returns `true` if
   every number in the list is even, `false` otherwise.
4. Design a function `count-in-range` that takes a list of numbers, a minimum value,
    and a maximum value, and returns how many numbers in the list are between the min
    and max (inclusive).
