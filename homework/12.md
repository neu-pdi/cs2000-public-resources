## Introduction

In this assignment, you'll work with the same housing data from New York City as you did in [Homework 4](/homework/4) and [Homework 5](/homework/5). You'll practice common data analysis tasks using Pandas.


## Problem 1

You have been provided with the same housing dataset as before, in the file `project-housing.csv`. It contains some missing values (which are represented by Pandas as NaN, which stands for `Not a Number`). Your first task is to clean the data by removing rows that contain any missing values.

- Load the CSV file `project-housing.csv` into a DataFrame named `housing_data`
- Remove all rows that contain any missing values (NaN). You can do this with the `dropna()` function on DataFrames.

**Important:** Make sure your code passes the provided test in `test_assignment.py` before moving on. This test verifies that your dataframe does not contain any NaN values. This checkpoint ensures you don't proceed to later problems with incomplete data.

## Problem 2

Filter the data to contain only properties within a bounding box that roughly contains Manhattan (it is rectangular, so includes parts of the Bronx, Queens, and Brooklyn as well). The bounding box coordinates are:

- Southwest corner: Latitude 40.701735, Longitude -74.019756 
- Northeast corner: Latitude 40.873392, Longitude -73.908128

Create a new DataFrame called `bounded_housing_data` that contains only the rows where:
- The `latitude` column is between 40.4774 and 40.9176 (inclusive)
- The `longitude` column is between -74.2591 and -73.7004 (inclusive)

**Hint:** Look at the `between` function offered by Pandas for Series objects.

Use `bounded_housing_data` for all remaining problems.

## Problem 3

In this problem, you'll write functions to compute basic statistics and apply them to the housing data.

### Part A

Write a function called `my_mean` that takes a list of numbers and returns the mean (average). The mean is calculated as the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

### Part B

Write a function called `my_std` that takes a list of numbers and returns the standard deviation. The standard deviation is calculated as follows:

1. Compute the mean of the values (you can use your `my_mean` function)
2. For each value, compute the difference between that value and the mean, then square that difference
3. Sum all of these squared differences
4. Divide the sum by the number of values
5. Take the square root of the result

### Part C

Extract the `lotarea` and `bldgarea` columns from `bounded_housing_data` and compute:

- `mean_lotarea`: the mean of the `lotarea` column
- `std_lotarea`: the standard deviation of the `lotarea` column
- `mean_bldgarea`: the mean of the `bldgarea` column
- `std_bldgarea`: the standard deviation of the `bldgarea` column

Use your `my_mean` and `my_std` functions to compute these values.

## Problem 4

Use the `apply` function in Pandas to create a new column called `bldgarea_percentage` in `bounded_housing_data`. This column should represent the percentage of the lot area occupied by the building, calculated as:

```
bldgarea_percentage = (bldgarea / lotarea) * 100
```

**Important:** Some properties have a `lotarea` of 0, which would cause a division by zero error. Your function should handle this case by returning 0 when `lotarea` is 0.

Write a function called `compute_building_percentage` that takes a row (as a Series) and returns the building percentage. Then use `apply` with `axis=1` to create the new column.

## Problem 5

Filter `bounded_housing_data` to create two separate DataFrames:

- `city_owned`: properties where `ownertype` equals "C"
- `tax_exempt`: properties where `ownertype` equals "X"

A helper function `plot_latlon_columns` has been provided in the starter code. This function takes two DataFrames (that should both have `latitude` and `longitude` columns) and two labels, then creates a scatter plot showing the locations of properties from both DataFrames in different colors.

Call `plot_latlon_columns` with `city_owned` (labeled "City-Owned") and `tax_exempt` (labeled "Tax-Exempt") to visualize where these properties are located.
