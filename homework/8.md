## Introduction

You're working on a student information system for a university. The system uses lists to track various data about students, including their grades, course enrollments, and academic records. Throughout this assignment, you'll use **recursive functions** to process and analyze this student data.

**DO NOT USE `for each` LOOPS!**

Assume grades are represented as numbers (0-100), and student names are represented as strings.

## Problem 1

Design a function `count-until-failing` that takes a list of grades and counts how many grades appear **BEFORE** the first failing grade (< 60). If there are no failing grades, return the total count of all grades.

## Problem 2

Design a function `valid-grade-sum` that takes a list of grades and returns the sum of all grades, but if any grade is invalid (negative or over 100), return -1 immediately without processing the rest.

## Problem 3

Design a function `grades-before-target` that takes a list of grades and a target grade, and returns a list of all grades that appear **BEFORE** the first occurrence of the target grade. If the target doesn't exist, return all grades.

## Problem 4

Design a function, `transform-numbers`, that takes a list of numbers as input. It should return a list of numbers, where the output list starts with the same numbers as the input list, until the first 0 occurs. This 0 should NOT be included, but all numbers after it, until the end or next 0, should be included but multiplied by -1. After the second 0, no numbers should be included. If no 0s occur, then the original list should be returned.

For example, the following transformations should occur:

```
1,2,3,0,4,5,6,0,7,8,9 --> 1,2,3,-4,-5,-6
1,2,3,4,5,6           --> 1,2,3,4,5,6
1,2,3,0,4,5,6         --> 1,2,3,-4,-5,-6
```
