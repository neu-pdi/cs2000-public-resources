## Reference: For all work with tables, refer to the [Tables](/tables) page in the menu at the top of the page!

## Intro (20 mins)

- Last time we saw operations on lists of numbers from [math](https://pyret.org/docs/latest/math.html) and [statistics](https://pyret.org/docs/latest/statistics.html). Today we are going to dive into many more built in operations on lists that come from [lists](https://pyret.org/docs/latest/lists.html).
- Imagine a list of discount codes used by a magazine:
  ```pyret
  discount-codes = [list: "NEWYEAR", "student", "NONE", "student", "VIP", "none"]
  ```
- Which may have come from a column of a table. As part of data cleaning, one
  thing you might want to do first is figure out what are the distinct codes
  used.
  ```pyret
  import lists as L

  unique-codes = L.distinct(discount-codes)
  ```
- We also have operations on lists that are similar to operations you saw
  previously on tables. For example, we can `L.filter` to remove codes that
  represent no discount (in this case, normalized "none").
  ```pyret
  fun is-real-code(code :: String) -> Boolean:
    not(string-to-lower(code) == "none")
  end

  real-codes = L.filter(is-real-code, unique-codes)
  ```
- Like how tables have `row-n()`, lists have a way of getting an element by position:
  ```pyret
  first-code = real-codes.get(0)
  ```
- For tables, we had a few ways of transforming the existing data -- adding a
  new column with `build-column`, or transforming a single column with
  `transform-column`. Since lists have only a single value, there is only one
  version, called `L.map`.
- We can use this to, e.g., get lowercase versions of each discount code:
  ```pyret
  lower-codes = L.map(string-to-lower, codes-real)
  ```

## Class Exercise (35 mins)

1. Using the discount codes from the intro, first apply `L.distinct` to remove
  duplicates, then use `L.map` with `string-to-upper` to convert all codes to
  uppercase. How many unique codes do you have after cleaning?
1. Given this list of survey responses: `[list: "yes", "NO", "maybe", "Yes", "no", "Maybe"]`, use `L.distinct` and `L.map` to create a list of unique
  responses in lowercase. Then use `L.filter` to keep only definitive answers
  (filter out "maybe").
1. Create a table of product prices:
    ```pyret
    products =
    table: name :: String, price :: Number
      row: "laptop", 999.99
      row: "mouse", 25.50
      row: "keyboard", 75.00
      row: "monitor", 299.99
    end
    ```
    Extract the price column and use `L.filter` to find products under $100.
    Then use `L.map` to apply a 10% discount to those prices.
1. Take the list `[list: "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]`
  and use `.get()` to access the third item (remember: 0-indexed). Separately, use
  `L.filter` to keep only fruits with names longer than 5 characters.
1. Load the Boston employees dataset (as in previous days), extract the "NAME"
  column, and use `L.filter` to find names that contain "Smith".
1. Create a list of student names: `[list: "alice", "Bob", "CHARLIE", "diana"]`.
  Use `L.map` to normalize all names to proper case (first letter uppercase,
  rest lowercase). You'll need to write a helper function that uses
  `string-to-upper` on the first character and `string-to-lower` on the rest, and use `string-substring` to extract the first character and rest.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)

- Lists have many built-in operations -- we showed a few, but there are more at https://pyret.org/docs/latest/lists.html.
