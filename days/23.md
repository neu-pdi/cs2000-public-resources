## Intro (20 mins)

- Yesterday we saw binary trees where each node has exactly two children. Today we explore **n-ary trees** where nodes can have any number of children.
- Real-world example: an organization chart, where each employee has a name, title, and a (possibly empty) list of direct reports.
- Tables struggle to represent nested relationships naturally—it's hard to find all indirect reports or the depth of the organization.
- Data Definition:
  ```pyret
  data OrgTree:
    | node(name :: String, title :: String, reports :: List<OrgTree>)
  end

  # Example: A small organization
  alex-tree = node("Alex", "Engineer", [list: ])
  casey-tree = node("Casey", "Engineer", [list: ])
  jordan-tree = node("Jordan", "CTO", [list: alex-tree, casey-tree])
  riley-tree = node("Riley", "Accountant", [list: ])
  taylor-tree = node("Taylor", "CFO", [list: riley-tree])
  avery-tree = node("Avery", "CEO", [list: jordan-tree, taylor-tree])
  ```
- Example: Check if someone is a leaf (has no reports):
  ```pyret
  fun is-leaf(t :: OrgTree) -> Boolean:
    cases (OrgTree) t:
      | node(name, title, reports) => L.empty(reports)
    end
  where:
    is-leaf(alex-tree) is true
    is-leaf(avery-tree) is false
  end
  ```
- Unlike binary trees, n-ary trees usually require **mutually recursive functions**—one function processes a single tree, another processes a list of trees -- the latter is what is called on the children, and calls back to the former.
- Example: Count all employees in the organization:
  ```pyret
  fun count-employees(t :: OrgTree) -> Number:
    cases (OrgTree) t:
      | node(name, title, reports) => 1 + count-employees-list(reports)
    end
  end

  fun count-employees-list(ts :: List<OrgTree>) -> Number:
    cases (List) ts:
      | empty => 0
      | link(first, rest) => count-employees(first) + count-employees-list(rest)
    end
  where:
    count-employees(alex-tree) is 1
    count-employees(avery-tree) is 6
  end
  ```

## Class Exercises (35 mins)

- Design a function `all-titles` that returns a list of all titles in the organization tree (duplicates are okay). You'll need both `all-titles` and `all-titles-list` functions.
- Design a function `count-by-title` that takes an `OrgTree` and a title string, and returns the number of employees with that title.
- Design a function `find-employee` that takes an `OrgTree` and a name, and returns the `OrgTree` node for that employee (or a special value if not found).
- Design a function `org-height` that returns the number of levels in the organization tree (root is level 1).
- Design a function `promote-all` that takes an `OrgTree` and a function from `String -> String`, and returns a new tree where every title has been updated by the function.
- Design a function `flatten-names` that returns a list of all employee names in the organization (pre-order traversal).
- Design a function `count-reports` that takes an `OrgTree` and a name, and returns how many people report directly to that employee.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)

- N-ary trees represent hierarchical data where nodes can have any number of children.
- Processing n-ary trees requires mutually recursive functions—one for single trees, one for lists of trees.
- The same patterns (counting, transforming, searching) apply to n-ary trees as binary trees.
