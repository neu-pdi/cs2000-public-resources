## Intro (20 mins)

- Another common form of data, in addition to numbers, strings, and images, are
  "true/false" values. These values, called "booleans" (after an Irish
  mathematician George Boole who studied them, in obscurity), have only two possibilities. In Pyret, written as:

  ```pyret
  true
  false
  ```

- This form of data allows us to express options, or choices. For example, we
  might want to ask whether the temperature is at or above 80F/27C, and if so, wear a
  sun hat.

- This requires two things. First, to be able to compare numbers (a current
  temperature, in F for example, and 80); there are many operators on numbers
  (and strings, etc) to ask questions like that, and they return boolean values. Second, to use the result of
  that comparison (a boolean) and do different things in your program depending
  on the result; this is the `if` expression.

- Let's design that function, `choose-hat`.

- **Step 1 type annotation:** `fun choose-hat(temp-in-F :: Number) -> String`.
  Since the result should be the hat I'm wearing, I'll return a `String`.

- **Step 2 doc string:** `doc: "determines appropriate head gear, with above 80F a sun hat, below nothing"`. Now we want to write our function. But how exactly
  should it work?

- **Step 3 of our design recipe for functions**, which we haven't seen before, is to **write down
  examples, in the form of tests cases, of how the function should behave**. We can
  include these in a `where` block for the function, and end up with this partially
  written function:

  ```pyret
  fun choose-hat(temp-in-F :: Number) -> String:
    doc: "determines appropriate head gear, with above 80F a sun hat, below nothing"
    # Missing body of function! That's the last step of the function design recipe.
  where:
    choose-hat(50) is "no hat"
    choose-hat(85) is "sun hat"
  end
  ```

- Is there another number we should check? Probably `80` as it's a boundary
  condition (i.e., right on the edge), which are common sources of bugs (what programmers
  call mistakes that cause programs not to behave as desired or expected!). Let's
  add another test for this:

  ```pyret
  fun choose-hat(temp-in-F :: Number) -> String:
    doc: "determines appropriate head gear, with above 80F a sun hat, below nothing"
    
  where:
    choose-hat(50) is "no hat"
    choose-hat(85) is "sun hat"
    choose-hat(80) is "sun hat"
  end
  ```

- Now, we can proceed to **Step 4 of our design recipe**, which is to write code:

  ```pyret
  fun choose-hat(temp-in-F :: Number) -> String:
    doc: "determines appropriate head gear, with above 80F a sun hat, below nothing"
    if temp-in-F > 80:
      "sun hat"
    else:
      "no hat"
    end
  where:
    choose-hat(50) is "no hat"
    choose-hat(85) is "sun hat"
    choose-hat(80) is "sun hat"
  end
  ```

- Now when we run Run, Pyret reports the results of running these tests.
  We can see one of our tests fails. What went wrong?

- We can think about what happened to "debug" (i.e., the programmers term
  for finding & removing bugs!) our code, but we can also use another tool, called `spy`, that Pyret gives us to help figure out the cause of the problem.
  This allows us to see expressions as code is running. The simplest form is to give it the names of identifiers, i.e.:

  ```pyret
  fun choose-hat(temp-in-F :: Number) -> String:
    doc: "determines appropriate head gear, with above 80F a sun hat, below nothing"
    spy:
      temp-in-F
    end
    if temp-in-F > 80:
      "sun hat"
    else:
      "no hat"
    end
  where:
    choose-hat(50) is "no hat"
    choose-hat(85) is "sun hat"
    choose-hat(80) is "sun hat"
  end
  ```

- But probably we also want to know the value of _comparison_. We can either define a new name for that:

  ```pyret
  fun choose-hat(temp-in-F :: Number) -> String:
    doc: "determines appropriate head gear, with above 80F a sun hat, below nothing"
    comparison = temp-in-F > 80
    spy:
      temp-in-F,
      comparison
    end
    if comparison:
      "sun hat"
    else:
      "no hat"
    end
  where:
    choose-hat(50) is "no hat"
    choose-hat(85) is "sun hat"
    choose-hat(80) is "sun hat"
  end
  ```

- Or, since that pattern is common, `spy` allows us to name expressions used just in the `spy` section, as:

  ```pyret
  fun choose-hat(temp-in-F :: Number) -> String:
    doc: "determines appropriate head gear, with above 80F a sun hat, below nothing"
    spy:
      temp-in-F,
      comparison: temp-in-F > 80
    end
    if temp-in-F > 80:
      "sun hat"
    else:
      "no hat"
    end
  where:
    choose-hat(50) is "no hat"
    choose-hat(85) is "sun hat"
    choose-hat(80) is "sun hat"
  end
  ```

- The difference between the last two is that in the former, `comparison` is
  added to the program directory inside `choose-hat`, but in the latter, the
  `comparison` name is only used for the `spy` expression.

- Now if we run again, we can see what went wrong: our comparison is checking that `temp-in-F` is
  strictly greater than `80`, but our test shows what we want it to be greater
  than *or equal to* 80.

## Class Exercise (30 mins)

- Add another possibility to `choose-hat`, that if the temperature is below
  `50`, you choose a winter hat. Any time you are changing code, you should
  revisit each step of the design recipe, in order, and change as appropriate
  (type signature, doc string, tests, code). To have more than one comparison, use:
  ```pyret
  if condition:
    ...
  else if condition:
    ...
  else if condition: # any number of times
    ...
  else:
    ...
  end
  ```
- Now imagine you got new sunglasses, and want to design a function `add-glasses` that takes
  an outfit (as a string) and always adds ", and glasses" to what you will wear.
- Let's now design a new function, `choose-outfit`, that takes as input the
  temperature in fahrenheit, and uses the two functions you just wrote to
  compute a final outfit. There are at least two ways of doing this; one
  defines a new local name with the result of calling `choose-hat`; the other directly passes the result of calling `choose-hat` to `add-glasses`
- Now, add a new function `choose-hat-or-visor` that takes not only a
  `temp-in-F`, but also an additional argument, `has-visor`, which is a boolean
  that indicates whether the person owns a visor. If they do, and the
  temperature is above 95F, they will wear that. Your function should be able to
  re-use logic from `choose-hat`. The boolean operator `and`, written `boolean1 and boolean2`, and evaluates to `true` if both inputs to it are `true`, will
  probably be useful! (Pyret also has `or`, which won't be useful in this
  problem, and a function `not`, i.e., `not(boolean1)` that evaluates to `false`
  when `boolean1` is true and vice versa).

## Wrap-up (10 mins)

- There is a useful **order** we should carry out when defining new functions, and we
  can make this concrete as a Design Recipe for functions:

  - Step 1. **Type Annotation** - Once we have decided we need to write a function, the
    first thing we should think about, assuming we were not told it, is what
    type of inputs the function should take and what type of output it should
    produce. While we introduced type annotations as a way to get better error
    messages, and indeed they are, this use as part of a design process is
    indeed much more important: it helps us organize our thoughts!

  - Step 2. **Doc String** - After figuring out the types of data the function operates
    over, it is worth writing down what the function should do! This is written in
    English, and it doesn't need to include how the function works (and usually
    shouldn't); the purpose of the explanation is so that someone can
    understand how to **use** the function, not how it works internally. While
    this serves as useful documentation, it is even more useful as part of a
    design process, since like type annotations, it helps us organize our
    thoughts; in particular, it makes us think a little bit more concretely about
    how the code should work -- i.e., how is the output constructed from the input.

  - Step 3. **Tests:** The third step is writing tests in a `where` block. These tests (or examples)
    serve as the most concrete step of our design process, as it's the point where we think through concrete cases of inputs, and exactly the output they should produce.
    It may be, as we write them, that we realize we did not think of something in the
    earlier steps, which is fine -- we go back and fix those and then continue forward.
    In addition to forming a useful step in the design process, these tests will also
    be used to check that our function works as expected!

  - Step 4. **Code** -- The last step, which we should only do **after** the first three, is writing
    down the code. There is a strong tendency for students, especially beginners, to want
    to jump ahead to this step, but the clarity that comes from doing the earlier steps will make
    writing the code easier, to the point that it is faster to not skip ahead.
