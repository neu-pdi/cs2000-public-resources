## Reference: For all work with tables, refer to the [Tables](/tables) page in the menu at the top of the page!

## Intro (25 mins)
- Consider you have a small cafe that tracks daily sales, where each row has the
  number of drinks sold:
  ```pyret
  cafe-data =
    table: day, drinks-sold
      row: "Mon", 45
      row: "Tue", 30
      row: "Wed", 55
      row: "Thu", 40
      row: "Fri", 60
    end
  ```
- There are many basic statistical questions we might want to ask -- e.g., what
  is the maximum number of drinks sold, the average sold per day, or the total
  sold.
- We can extract single _columns_ from tables, and then use standard
  operations from two different software libraries -- `math` and `statistics`
  -- to operate over those columns. 
  ```pyret
  import math as M
  import statistics as S

  sales = cafe-data.get-column("drinks-sold")
  M.max(sales)      # maximum sales
  S.mean(sales)     # average sales
  M.sum(sales)      # total sold
  ```
- Here, `import math as M` declares that you want to use code that comes from
  Pyret's `math` library (https://pyret.org/docs/latest/math.html), and in order
  to not get confused between the functions provided from it and the functions
  available by default or defined by you, the `as M` gives the library a short
  name. This means that any function `function-name` from the `math` library is
  availabe as `M.function-name`. The choice `M` is arbitrary -- but convention
  is to use capital letters, and usually just one or two.
- If you aren't worried about mixing up functions from the library, you can
  instead write:
  ```pyret
  include math
  ```
  This adds all the functions from the `math` library to the current program directory 
  with no change of name, so we could write the above alternately as:
  ```pyret
  include math
  include statistics

  sales = cafe-data.get-column("drinks-sold")
  max(sales)      # maximum sales
  mean(sales)    # average sales
  sum(sales)     # total  sold
  ```

  However, the context that we use for most programs in this class `dcic2024` already defines many of the names defined in the `statistics` library as _table_ functions (as we saw on [Day 7](/days/7)), so Pyret will give you a shadowing error if you try to do that.

- A column is a type of data called a `list` -- if we print it out we can see
  that it looks like:
  ```pyret
  cafe-data.get-column("drinks-sold")
  ```
  This shows at the interactions as:
  ```pyret
  [list: 45, 30, 55, 40, 60]
  ```
- Lists have order, but no column header, and unlike tables, only a single value
  per entry.
- We can define list values directly using the above syntax:
  ```pyret
  sample-list = [list: 10, 20, 30]
  empty-list = [list: ]
  ```
- And lists can have any type of data in them. On lists of _numbers_ we can use
  functions from `math` and `statistics` on them. 
  
  
## Class Exercise (30 mins)
- Using the cafe data from the intro, extract the "day" column and determine
  which day appears first alphabetically using `M.min`. Then extract both
  columns and create a list of the total drinks sold across all days using
  `M.sum`.
- Create a new table of student quiz scores:
  ```pyret
  quiz-scores =
    table: student, quiz1, quiz2, quiz3
      row: "Alice", 85, 92, 78
      row: "Bob", 90, 88, 95
      row: "Charlie", 78, 85, 82
      row: "Diana", 95, 90, 88
    end
  ```
  Extract each quiz column and calculate the class average for each quiz using
  `S.mean`. Which quiz had the highest average?
- Create a list directly using the syntax `[list: 12, 8, 15, 22, 5, 18]` and
  use functions from the `math` library to find the minimum, maximum, and sum.
  What's the range (difference between max and min)?
- Load the employees dataset from https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report
  using the CSV URL (as in Day 9). Extract the "REGULAR" column, convert it to
  numbers using the `string-to-number-unsafe` helper from Day 9, and calculate
  the average regular salary across all employees.


## Wrap-Up (5 mins)
- Columns can be extracted from tables -- these are lists. 
- Many built in functions work on lists of values.
