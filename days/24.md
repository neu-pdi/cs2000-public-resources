## Setup

Before doing the pre-reading, and doing work in class, we need to install VSCode & Python on your computer. We present instructions for MacOS and Windows; iPads are not supported (and if you use Linux, and need help, reach out to course staff -- we'd be happy to help).

### Steps

- [ ]  Install **VSCode**
  
  **Windows & macOS**

  1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download VSCode.
  2. Run the installer and accept defaults.
  3. Launch VSCode. 
- [ ]  **Disable AI autocomplete** in VSCode

  Using AI autocomplete is against our course [AI Policy](/syllabus#the-ai-policy). Turn off Copilot/any AI autocompletions.

  > **Note:** If this is your first time installing VSCode, you can likely skip this step. It’s mainly for people who already had VSCode installed and might have GitHub Copilot or another AI completion tool enabled.  Do not enable any AI completions for the remainder of this course.

  1. In VSCode, open the **Extensions** tab on the left sidebar. It looks like this:
  ![VSCode Extensions Icon](/img/vscode-ext.png)
  2. In the search bar, type **“Copilot”**.
  3. If you see **GitHub Copilot** or **Copilot Chat** extensions:
  ![VSCode Github Copilot Extension](/img/vscode-copilot.png)
    - Click **Disable**
  4. Repeat for any other AI completion extensions you may have (e.g., Codeium, Tabnine, CodeWhisperer).)

- [ ]  Install **Python 3.11+**

  We will use Python version 3.11 or higher in this course. Please follow the below instructions to install a Python interpreter that works with VScode.

  #### 3.1 Confirm your current version

  Before installing anything, check if you already have a compatible version of Python by opening the VSCode Terminal (Terminal Window -> New Terminal) and typing the following and hitting Enter/Return:

  **macOS:**

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

  **Windows:**

  ```bash
  py -3 --version
  ```

  If this gives you an error, or reports a version of Python below **3.11**, follow the steps below.

  #### 3.2 Install Python

  #### Windows

  1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  2. Click **“Download Python install manager”** (the big yellow button).
  ![Python Website](/img/pythoninstall.png)
  3. Run the installer and click **Install Now**.
  4. After installation, open a new Terminal and verify by typing the following and hitting return:
    
    ```bash
    py -3 --version
    ```
    
    You should see something like `Python 3.11.9`. Any version 3.11 or higher is fine.
  #### macOS

  > ⚠️ macOS comes with an older “system Python” used by the OS. Do **not** use that version. Instead, install your own Python 3.11+.

  1. Visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  2. Download the **macOS 64-bit universal installer** for Python 3.11+.
  3. Open the `.pkg` file and follow the prompts.
  4. After installation, open a VSCode Terminal and verify by typing the following and hitting return:
    
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
    
    This should print something like `Python 3.11.9`. Any version 3.11 or higher is fine.
- [ ]  Create a project folder, and set up **virtual environment**
  
  1. Open VS Code
  2. Click on the **Explorer** icon on the left sidebar. It looks like this:
  ![VSCode Explorer Icon](/img/vscode-explorer.png
  3. Click Open Folder)
  ![VSCode Open Folder](/img/vscode-folder.png)
  4. In the dialog that appears:
    - Choose where you want your folder (e.g., Desktop or Documents)
    - Click **New Folder**
    - Name it `cs2000-day24` , then click Select Folder (Windows) or Open (Mac)
  5. Once the folder opens in VS Code, look at the **Explorer** panel. It should now show your folder name at the top.
  6. Click the **New File** icon
  7. Type `scratch.py` and press **Enter**. The file will open in the editor.
  
  Now set up the Virtual Environment
  > We will use a per‑project virtual environment named .venv so tools run consistently.

  1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` → type **Python: Create Environment**.
  2. Choose "Quick Create", which should say "Uses Python version 3.XX", where that was the version you installed.
  3. You’ll see the Python version displayed in the bottom-right corner once a `.py` file is open, written as `.venv (3.XX)`.
- [ ]  Install VSCode extensions: **Python**, **Pylint**, **Mypy Type Checker**
  TODO
- [ ]  Configure **Pylint** args
  TODO
- [ ]  Configure **MyPy** args
  TODO
- [ ]  Install **pandas** and **pandas-stubs** inside the virtual environment
  TODO
- [ ]  Install **Github Desktop**, configure it.

## Intro (20 mins)

- Today we begin our transition from Pyret to Python.
- Python and Pyret share many core ideas, but use different notation and conventions -- more significantly, the Pyret programming environment is designed to be easy to use, whereas there is more involved setup for Python.

**Example: Function to compute gadget cost**

- Pyret:
  ```pyret
  fun gadget-cost(num-gadgets :: Number, label :: String) -> Number:
    doc: "computes cost, at $0.50 per gadget plus $0.05 per character in label"
    num-gadgets * (0.50 + (string-length(label) * 0.05))
  where:
    gadget_cost(1, "hi") is 0.55
    gadget_cost(10, "tech") is 6.00
  end
  ```
- Python:
  ```python
  def gadget_cost(num_gadgets: int, label: str) -> float:
      """ computes cost, at $0.50 per gadget plus $0.05 per character in label """
      return num_gadgets * (0.50 + (len(label) * 0.05))
  # Testing -- we'll come back to this
  ```

**Example: Conditionals**

- Pyret:
  ```pyret
  fun add-shipping(order-amt :: Number) -> Number:
    doc: "adds 4 for orders <= 10 (but non-zero), 8 for orders < 30, 12 for larger orders"
    if order-amt == 0:
      0
    else if order-amt <= 10:
      order-amt + 4
    else if order-amt < 30:
      order-amt + 8
    else:
      order-amt + 12
    end
  end
  ```
- Python:
  ```python
  def add_shipping(order_amt: float) -> float:
      """ adds 4 for orders <= 10 (but non-zero), 8 for orders < 30, 12 for larger orders """
      if order_amt == 0:
          return 0
      elif order_amt <= 10:
          return order_amt + 4
      elif order_amt < 30:
          return order_amt + 8
      else:
          return order_amt + 12
  # Testing -- we'll come back to this
  ```

**Testing in Python with pytest**

- In Pyret, you use `where:` blocks for examples/tests. In Python, there are multiple ways to write tests, but a simple (and widely used) mechanism is using `pytest`, where you write separate test functions using `assert`.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  import pytest

  def gadget_cost(num_gadgets: int, label: str) -> float:
      return num_gadgets * (0.50 + (len(label) * 0.05))

  def test_gadget_cost():
      assert gadget_cost(1, "hi") == pytest.approx(0.55)
      assert gadget_cost(10, "tech") == pytest.approx(6.00)
  ```
- **Conventions:**
  - Test functions must be named starting with `test_`.
  - Use `assert` to check expected results. It takes a boolean expression and causes a test failure if it evaluates to `False`.
  - For floating-point (any decimal in Python) results, use `pytest.approx` for comparison.
- **How to run tests:**
  1. Save your code in a file, e.g., `gadget.py`.
  2. In the terminal, run:
     ```
     pytest gadget.py
     ```
  3. pytest will find and run all functions named `test_*` and report results.

## Class Exercises (35 mins)

1. **Function Syntax Practice**

   - Rewrite the following Pyret function in Python:
     ```pyret
     fun greet(name :: String) -> String:
       doc: "produces Hello, name!"
       "Hello, " + name + "!"
     where:
       greet("Alice") is "Hello, Alice!"
       greet("Bob") is "Hello, Bob!"
     end
     ```
     Be sure to follow full design recipe, including a docstring and test cases.
   - Now, design a Python function that takes a name and an age, and returns a string like `"Alice is 20 years old."`

2. **Conditionals**

   - Translate this Pyret function to Python:
     ```pyret
     fun shipping-cost(weight :: Number) -> Number:
       doc: "if weight <= 1, cost is $5; if weight <= 5, cost is $10; otherwise, $20"
       if weight <= 1:
         5
       else if weight <= 5:
         10
       else:
         20
       end
     end
     ```
   - Design a Python function `grade_letter(score: int) -> str` that returns `"A"` for scores 90 and above, `"B"` for 80–89, `"C"` for 70–79, `"D"` for 60–69, and `"F"` otherwise.

3. **Return Statement**

   - What happens if you forget the `return` statement in a Python function? Try it and observe the result.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)

- Python and Pyret share core ideas, but differ in syntax and conventions.
- Next time: more on Python data and control structures.
