## VSCode and Python 

Before doing the pre-reading, and doing work in class, we need to install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) & Python on your computer. We present instructions for MacOS and Windows; iPads are not supported (and if you use Linux, and need help, reach out to course staff -- we'd be happy to help).
