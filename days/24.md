## Skills: [8](</skills/#(8)>)

## Setup

Before doing the pre-reading, and doing work in class, we need to install VSCode & Python on your computer. We present instructions for MacOS and Windows; iPads are not supported (and if you use Linux, and need help, reach out to course staff -- we'd be happy to help).

### Steps

- [ ]  Install **VSCode**
  
  **Windows & macOS**

  1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download VSCode.
  2. Run the installer and accept defaults.
  3. Launch VSCode. 
- [ ]  **Disable AI autocomplete** in VSCode

  Using AI autocomplete is against our course [AI Policy](/syllabus#the-ai-policy). Turn off Copilot/any AI autocompletions.

  > **Note:** If this is your first time installing VSCode, you can likely skip this step. It’s mainly for people who already had VSCode installed and might have GitHub Copilot or another AI completion tool enabled.  Do not enable any AI completions for the remainder of this course.

  1. In VSCode, open the **Extensions** tab on the left sidebar. It looks like this:
  ![VSCode Extensions Icon](/img/vscode-ext.png)
  2. In the search bar, type **“Copilot”**.
  3. If you see **GitHub Copilot** or **Copilot Chat** extensions:
  ![VSCode Github Copilot Extension](/img/vscode-copilot.png)
    - Click **Disable**
  4. Repeat for any other AI completion extensions you may have (e.g., Codeium, Tabnine, CodeWhisperer).)

- [ ]  Install **Python 3.11+**

  We will use Python version 3.11 or higher in this course. Please follow the below instructions to install a Python interpreter that works with VScode.

  #### 3.1 Confirm your current version

  Before installing anything, check if you already have a compatible version of Python by opening the VSCode Terminal (Terminal Window -> New Terminal) and typing the following and hitting Enter/Return:

  **macOS:**

  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

  **Windows:**

  ```bash
  py -3 --version
  ```

  If this gives you an error, or reports a version of Python below **3.11**, follow the steps below.

  #### 3.2 Install Python

  #### Windows

  1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  2. Click **“Download Python install manager”** (the big yellow button).
  ![Python Website](/img/pythoninstall.png)
  3. Run the installer and click **Install Now**.
  4. After installation, open a new Terminal and verify by typing the following and hitting return:
    
    ```bash
    py -3 --version
    ```
    
    You should see something like `Python 3.11.9`. Any version 3.11 or higher is fine.
  #### macOS

  > ⚠️ macOS comes with an older “system Python” used by the OS. Do **not** use that version. Instead, install your own Python 3.11+.

  1. Visit [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  2. Download the **macOS 64-bit universal installer** for Python 3.11+.
  3. Open the `.pkg` file and follow the prompts.
  4. After installation, open a VSCode Terminal and verify by typing the following and hitting return:
    
    ```bash
    python3 --version
    ```
    
    This should print something like `Python 3.11.9`. Any version 3.11 or higher is fine.

- [ ]  Install & Configure VSCode extensions: **Python**, **Python Environments**, **Pylint**, **Mypy Type Checker**
  
  1. Open the Extensions view (left sidebar icon with 4 squares):
    ![VSCode Extensions Icon](/img/vscode-ext.png)
  2. Install Python Extension
    
      a. There is an extension in VSCode that enables Python features.  
      b. Search for **“Python”** by **Microsoft**.
        - Make sure that the extension's entire name is "Python" (not "Python Debugger")
      c. Click **Install**. 
        ![Python Extension](/img/pythonextension.png)
  3. Install Python Environments Extension
    
      a. Search for **"Python Environments"** by **Microsoft**

      b. Click **Install**
  
  4. Install Pylint Extension

    We will use Pylint [(documentation here)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.pylint) to check that our code follows the style guidelines. The autograder for each assignment will also be running Pylint.

    a. In the Extensions tab, search “Pylint” and click Install.
      ![Pylint Install](/img/pylintinstall.png)
    b. Then, go to VSCode's Settings menu
      - Mac: `Code` > `Settings...` > `Settings` (or `Cmd` + `,`)
      - Windows: `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` (or `Ctrl` + `,`)
    c. Navigate to `Extensions` > `Pylint`
    d. In the **Args** section, add these two args:
    ```--disable=import-error```
    ```--disable=assignment-from-no-return``` (Click "Add Item" for each one.)
    ![Pylint Args](/img/pylintargs.png)

    

  5. Install MyPy Type Checker Extension

    We will use MyPy to report type errors in our programs.

    a. In the Extensions tab, search for “Mypy Type Checker” and click Install.
      ![MyPy Install](/img/mypyinstall.png)
    b. Then, go to VSCode's Settings menu
      - Mac: `Code` > `Settings...` > `Settings` (or `Cmd` + `,`)
      - Windows: `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` (or `Ctrl` + `,`)
    c. Navigate to `Extensions` > `Mypy Type Checker`
    d. In the `Args` section, add these five args:
      ```--strict```
      ```--disallow-untyped-defs```
      ```--disable-error-code=empty-body```
      ```--disable-error-code=return```
      ```--explicit-package-bases``` (Click "Add Item" for each one.)
      ![MyPy Args](/img/mypyarg.png)

      

    e. Now, any missing or mismatched types will be reported in the "Problems" tab every time you save or open a file

  - [ ]  Create a project folder, and set up **virtual environment**
  
  1. Open VS Code
  2. Click on the **Explorer** icon on the left sidebar. It looks like this:
  ![VSCode Explorer Icon](/img/vscode-explorer.png)
  3. Click Open Folder)
  ![VSCode Open Folder](/img/vscode-folder.png)
  4. In the dialog that appears:
    - Choose where you want your folder (e.g., Desktop or Documents)
    - Click **New Folder**
    - Name it `cs2000-day24` , then click Select Folder (Windows) or Open (Mac)
  5. Once the folder opens in VS Code, look at the **Explorer** panel. It should now show your folder name at the top.
  6. Click the **New File** icon
  7. Type `scratch.py` and press **Enter**. The file will open in the editor.
  
  Now set up the Virtual Environment
  > We will use a per‑project virtual environment named .venv so tools run consistently.

  1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` → type **Python: Create Environment**.
  2. Choose "Quick Create", which should say "Uses Python version 3.XX", where that was the version you installed.
  3. You’ll see the Python version displayed in the bottom-right corner once a `.py` file is open, written as `.venv (3.XX)`.

  4. If MyPy is set up properly, then this code, added to our `scratch.py` file:

      ```python
      def add(num1: int, num2) -> int:
        return num1 + num2

      result: str = add(3, 'hi')

      def func() -> int:
        pass
      ```

      Once we save, should result in three errors in red (there will also be warnings from Pylint, in blue, about missing doc strings, both for the functions, and at the top of the file): num2's missing type, add()'s returning something other than the promised int, and result's value being an int when the variable type is str.


- [ ]  Install **pandas** and **pandas-stubs** inside the virtual environment
  
  Each project we work in should have its own virtual environment, which means it will have its own set of packages, which are existing pieces of software that allow us to work on particular tasks. 

  We will use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), a popular library for data analysis, for work with tables and spreadsheets.

  You can add Pandas to your virtual environment by clicking on the Python icon in the side bar (it may be hidden behind the three dots):

  ![VSCode Python Icon](/img/pythonicon.png)

  Then, under Environment Managers, find your Venv as `.venv (3.XX)`, and click the little icon that says "Manage Packages" when you hover over it:

  ![VSCode venv packages](/img/venvpackages.png)

  Now type "pandas" and check both "pandas" **and** "pandas-stubs" and then hit OK.

  ![VSCode Pandas Pkg](/img/pandaspkg.png)

- [ ]  Log into **Github** in **VSCode**
  
  1. Click on the icon in the bottom left of VSCode:

  ![VSCode Login](/img/vscodesignin.png)

  2. Click "Sign in"

  3. Select "Github", and follow prompts in browser that pops up.

  4. You should be redirected back to VSCode, and now if you click on the same icon, it should now say `yourusername (Github)` at the top.

  5. To get one of your HW repositories, first find it on Github.com (follow the link from Pawtograder). Click on the green Code button, click on the HTTPS option, and click the icon to copy the url.

  ![Github HTTPS Code](/img/githubhttps.png)
  
  6. Now Open a new VSCode window, and then click on the Source Control icon. Click the button that says "Clone Repository". Paste the url you got in the previous step into the text field that pops up.

  ![VSCode Clone](/img/vscodeclone.png)

  7. The first time you do this, you will be asked to authenticate with Github.

  8. VSCode will prompt you to select a folder where it will store this on your computer. Remember where you place it!

  7. Once you open the repository, you can say "Yes, Trust the Authors"

    ![VSCode Trust](/img/vscodetrust.png)

  8. Create a Virtual Environment for the HW. **NOTE: YOU MUST DO THIS FOR EVERY HW/LAB**

    1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` → type **Python: Create Environment**.
    2. Choose "Quick Create", which should say "Uses Python version 3.XX", where that was the version you installed.
    3. You’ll see the Python version displayed in the bottom-right corner once a `.py` file is open, written as `.venv (3.XX)`.

  9. Whenever you want to commit & push, go to the Source Control panel as you did in Github.dev.

[Transition to Python 1](https://northeastern.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=276f7e6e-1b42-4301-9459-b37c00d3cf7f)

## Intro (20 mins)

- Today we begin our transition from Pyret to Python.
- Python and Pyret share many core ideas, but use different notation and conventions -- more significantly, the Pyret programming environment is designed to be easy to use, whereas there is more involved setup for Python.

**Example: Function to compute gadget cost**

- Pyret:
  ```pyret
  fun gadget-cost(num-gadgets :: Number, label :: String) -> Number:
    doc: "computes cost, at $0.50 per gadget plus $0.05 per character in label"
    num-gadgets * (0.50 + (string-length(label) * 0.05))
  where:
    gadget_cost(1, "hi") is 0.55
    gadget_cost(10, "tech") is 6.00
  end
  ```
- Python:
  ```python
  def gadget_cost(num_gadgets: int, label: str) -> float:
      """ computes cost, at $0.50 per gadget plus $0.05 per character in label """
      return num_gadgets * (0.50 + (len(label) * 0.05))
  # Testing -- we'll come back to this
  ```

**Example: Conditionals**

- Pyret:
  ```pyret
  fun add-shipping(order-amt :: Number) -> Number:
    doc: "adds 4 for orders <= 10 (but non-zero), 8 for orders < 30, 12 for larger orders"
    if order-amt == 0:
      0
    else if order-amt <= 10:
      order-amt + 4
    else if order-amt < 30:
      order-amt + 8
    else:
      order-amt + 12
    end
  end
  ```
- Python:
  ```python
  def add_shipping(order_amt: float) -> float:
      """ adds 4 for orders <= 10 (but non-zero), 8 for orders < 30, 12 for larger orders """
      if order_amt == 0:
          return 0
      elif order_amt <= 10:
          return order_amt + 4
      elif order_amt < 30:
          return order_amt + 8
      else:
          return order_amt + 12
  # Testing -- we'll come back to this
  ```

**Testing in Python with pytest**

- In Pyret, you use `where:` blocks for examples/tests. In Python, there are multiple ways to write tests, but a simple (and widely used) mechanism is using `pytest`, where you write separate test functions using `assert`.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  import pytest

  def gadget_cost(num_gadgets: int, label: str) -> float:
      return num_gadgets * (0.50 + (len(label) * 0.05))

  def test_gadget_cost():
      assert gadget_cost(1, "hi") == pytest.approx(0.55)
      assert gadget_cost(10, "tech") == pytest.approx(6.00)
  ```
- **Conventions:**
  - Test functions must be named starting with `test_`.
  - Use `assert` to check expected results. It takes a boolean expression and causes a test failure if it evaluates to `False`.
  - For floating-point (any decimal in Python) results, use `pytest.approx` for comparison.
- **How to run tests:**
  1. Save your code in a file, e.g., `gadget.py`.
  2. In the terminal, run:
     ```
     pytest gadget.py
     ```
  3. pytest will find and run all functions named `test_*` and report results.

## Class Exercises (35 mins)

1. **Function Syntax Practice**

   - Rewrite the following Pyret function in Python:
     ```pyret
     fun greet(name :: String) -> String:
       doc: "produces Hello, name!"
       "Hello, " + name + "!"
     where:
       greet("Alice") is "Hello, Alice!"
       greet("Bob") is "Hello, Bob!"
     end
     ```
     Be sure to follow full design recipe, including a docstring and test cases.
   - Now, design a Python function that takes a name and an age, and returns a string like `"Alice is 20 years old."`

2. **Conditionals**

   - Translate this Pyret function to Python:
     ```pyret
     fun shipping-cost(weight :: Number) -> Number:
       doc: "if weight <= 1, cost is $5; if weight <= 5, cost is $10; otherwise, $20"
       if weight <= 1:
         5
       else if weight <= 5:
         10
       else:
         20
       end
     end
     ```
   - Design a Python function `grade_letter(score: int) -> str` that returns `"A"` for scores 90 and above, `"B"` for 80–89, `"C"` for 70–79, `"D"` for 60–69, and `"F"` otherwise.

3. **Return Statement**

   - What happens if you forget the `return` statement in a Python function? Try it and observe the result.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)

- Python and Pyret share core ideas, but differ in syntax and conventions.
- Next time: more on Python data and control structures.
