title: Day 22 - Intro to trees & Trees as recursive data
---

## Skills: [6](/skills/#(6))

## Pre-reading: [7.1.1]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/trees.html#(part._ancestor-trees)), [7.1.2]({{DCIC_DOMAIN}}/trees.html#(part._.Programs_to_.Process_.Ancestor_.Trees))

## Intro (20 mins)
- Today we introduce **trees**—a way to represent hierarchical data where each item can have sub-items.
- Real-world example: a river network, where streams merge into larger streams and rivers.
- Tables can't easily represent this branching structure—each merge point connects to exactly two upstream sources.
- We can model this as a **binary tree** (which are the simplest form of tree), where each node has two sub nodes. Trees are similar to lists, in that they are conditional data where one case is the end (or base) and the other is a recursive case, but unlike lists, the recursive case has _multiple_ self-referential fields -- below, `left` and `right`.
- River network as conditional data:
  ```pyret
  data River:
    | merge(width :: Number, left :: River, right :: River)
    | stream(flow-rate :: Number)
  end

  # Example: A small river network
  stream-a = stream(5)
  stream-b = stream(8)
  stream-c = stream(3)
  merge-1 = merge(12, stream-a, stream-b)
  main-river = merge(15, merge-1, stream-c)
  ```
- Example function: calculate total flow in a river network
  ```pyret
  fun total-flow(r :: River) -> Number:
    cases (River) r:
      | merge(width, left, right) => total-flow(left) + total-flow(right)
      | stream(flow) => flow
    end
  where:
    total-flow(stream-a) is 5
    total-flow(main-river) is 16
  end
  ```
- Example function: count merge points in a river network
  ```pyret
  fun count-merges(r :: River) -> Number:
    cases (River) r:
      | merge(width, left, right) => 1 + count-merges(left) + count-merges(right)
      | stream(flow) => 0
    end
  where:
    count-merges(stream-a) is 0
    count-merges(main-river) is 2
  end
  ```

## Class Exercises (35 mins)
- Design a function `count-streams` that counts how many individual streams feed
  into a river network.
- Design a function `max-width` that finds the maximum width among all merge
  points in a river network.
- Design a function `widen-river` that takes a river network and a number, and
  returns a new network where every merge point is wider by that amount.
- Design a function `cap-flow` that takes a river network and returns a new
  network where no stream has flow-rate above 10 (cap any higher values at 10).
- Design a function `has-large-stream` that returns `true` if any stream in the
  network has flow-rate greater than 6.

<!--
These seem like too much, but not deleting, in case they end up being useful later!
**Fruit tree exercises:**

Define a new tree type for fruit trees:
```pyret
data FruitTree:
  | branch(left :: FruitTree, right :: FruitTree)
  | leaf
  | fruit(size :: Number, ripe :: Boolean)
end
```

- Write a function `count-leaves` that counts the number of leaf nodes in a
  fruit tree.
- Write a function `count-ripe-fruit` that counts how many ripe fruits are in a
  fruit tree.
- Write a function `total-fruit-size` that sums the sizes of all fruits in a
  fruit tree.
- Write a function `has-large-fruit` that returns `true` if any fruit in the
  tree has size greater than 5.
- Write a function `ripen-all` that takes a fruit tree and returns a new tree
  where all fruits are marked as ripe. -->

## Wrap-up (5 mins)
- Binary trees naturally represent branching structures like river networks.
- Recursive data definitions with multiple variants capture tree structure.
- Recursive functions use `cases` to handle each variant appropriately.
- Tree processing often follows patterns: reductions (sum, count) and transformations (map-like operations).
