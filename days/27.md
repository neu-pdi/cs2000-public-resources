## Skills: [9](</skills/#(9)>)

## Pre-reading: [9.1.8](<%7B%7BDCIC_DOMAIN%7D%7D/intro-python.html#(part._python-traverse-lists)>) (skip 9.1.8.5, since we've already seen that on [Day 15](/days/14)).

## Intro (10 mins)

- Today we focus on traversing and transforming lists in Python using for loops, and compare with Pyret's approaches.
- **Example: Summing a List**
  - Python:
    ```python
    def sum_list(num_list: list) -> float:
        """Returns the sum of all numbers in the list."""
        run_total = 0
        for num in num_list:
            run_total = run_total + num
        return run_total

    def test_sum_list():
        assert sum_list([1, 2, 3]) == 6
        assert sum_list([]) == 0
    ```
  - Pyret (`for each` loop):
    ```pyret
    fun sum-list-for(numlist :: List<Number>) -> Number block:
      doc: "Returns the sum of all numbers in the list using a for loop."
      var sum = 0
      for each(n from numlist):
        sum := sum + n
      end
      sum
    where:
      sum-list-for([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 6
      sum-list-for([list: ]) is 0
    end
    ```
  - Pyret (recursive):
    ```pyret
    fun sum-list(numlist :: List<Number>) -> Number:
      doc: "Returns the sum of all numbers in the list."
      cases (List) numlist:
        | empty => 0
        | link(fst, rst) => fst + sum-list(rst)
      end
    where:
      sum-list([list: 1, 2, 3]) is 6
      sum-list([list: ]) is 0
    end
    ```

## Class Exercises (45 mins)

For each function, follow the full design recipe: type signature, docstring, tests, and code.

- Design a Python function `product_list(nums: list) -> float` that returns the product of all numbers in the list (1 for empty list).

- Design a Python function `count_occurrences(items: list, target) -> int` that returns how many times `target` appears in the list.

- Design a Python function `filter_by_prefix(words: list, prefix: str) -> list` that returns a list of all words starting with the given prefix. In Python, if you have a string `s`, you can check if it starts with a prefix using `s.startswith(prefix)`.

- Design a Python function `reverse_list(lst: list) -> list` that returns a new list with the elements in reverse order (do not use `reversed()` or `[::-1]`).

- Design a Python function `all_with_letter(words: list, letter: str) -> list` that returns all words containing the given letter. In Python, you can check if a string contains a letter using `letter in word`.

- For one of the above problems, write the equivalent function in Pyret using both recursion and a `for each` loop.

## Wrap-up (5 mins)

- Python for loops and mutable accumulators are a common way to process lists. While recursion can be done, it is less idiomatic in Python for lists (for trees, `for` loops are much more difficult, and recursion is idiomatic).
- Pyret supports both recursion and iteration; both approaches have strengths.
